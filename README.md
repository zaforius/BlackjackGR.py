Project Title: BlackJackGR
Description
BlackJackGR is a text-based Blackjack game, designed for the Greek audience and implemented in Python 3.11. The game utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and custom functions. The purpose of this project is to showcase my Python skills to potential employers.

Installation
This game is contained in a single Python file (BlackjackGR.py). Here's how to get it running:

Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed on your system. If you don't have it, download it from the official Python website.

Clone this repository or download the BlackjackGR.py file.

Run the file in your Python environment. If you're using a terminal, you can navigate to the directory containing the file and use the command python BlackjackGR.py.

Usage
Once you've started the game, you'll be presented with clear binary choices.

First, you'll be asked to enter your starting chips within a range of 50-500.
Next, you'll be prompted to enter your bet.
Then, you'll be faced with a binary choice: "hit" or "stand".
Continue playing following the prompts given by the game.

Contributing
Currently, this project isn't open for contributions, as it's a personal showcase project. However, if you have suggestions or find a bug, feel free to open an issue!
